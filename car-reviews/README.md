# Why the App looks like it does:
Blue and white is a standard scheme you see across the web nowadays, from Facebook to Twitter, blue and white is a color that works. It works because blue evokes calm, credibility, neatness, while white compliments it perfectly. While researching different color schemes, we came to our decision based on the choice to go with a Flat design, meaning very subtle, minimal 3D effects, no borders, clean layout. Flat design is also very popular these days.
Our app also utilizes Minimalist design. Minimalism can be most easily defined as stripped to it's essentials. We originally choose a more robust flat design with use of graphics and icons, but the UI quickly became cluttered, and since minimalism is inherent with Flat design, it seemed like a natural pivot.

* Color Scheme:
    - ![darker blue](https://www.beautycolorcode.com/2F77F3.png)
    - #2F77F3 / rgb(47,119,243) - darker blue
    - https://www.color-hex.com/color/2f77f3
        - This color is used when a darker shade of blue is neccessary to make something stand out against a white background, like fonts.

    - #77A6F7 / rgb(119,166,247) - light blue
    - https://www.color-hex.com/color/77a6f7
        - This, in combination with white, will be our 'dominant color', used for backgrounds of the search bar, nav bar, and other backgrounds. Blue evokes trust, security, and calmness, which are feelings we want our Users to feel when reading reviews.



    - ![white](https://www.beautycolorcode.com/FFFFFF.png)
    - #FFFFFF / rgb(255, 255, 255) - white
